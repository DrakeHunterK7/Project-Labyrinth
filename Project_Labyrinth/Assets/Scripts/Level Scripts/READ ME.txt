IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING MAP GENERATION

-- Scaling

In order to make things easy to generate we are going to be treating each cell within the grid as 5 meters

This means that a 5 x 3 unit grid in world space will act as a 25m x 15m room
This means that hallways, by default, will be 5m x 5m rooms each.

This is is we can make sure that map generation runs smoothly, since it will be a massive pain in the ass to 
rewrite it to accomidate for resizing and fitting multiple cells into different dimensions.

Therefore, going forward when placing items it will be important to resize them in comparison to the player character.

I'll be talking to Anas on how about going through with this but for now while testing I'll simply be making the player roughly
1.8m tall, or 0.36 times the size of a single hallway for testing purposes.

Will update this document if anything has changed going forward.

-- IMPORTANT

Each room prefab must have a collider and rigidbody component

This will make sure that they properly check for collision when placing the rooms down
